`spatie/schema-org` provides a fluent builder for **all** Schema.org types and their properties. The code in `src` is generated from Schema.org's [RFDa standards file](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/blob/master/data/schema.rdfa), so it provides objects and methods for the entire core vocabulary. The classes and methods are also fully documented as a quick reference.

```php
use Spatie\SchemaOrg\Schema;

$localBusiness = Schema::localBusiness()
    ->name('Spatie')
    ->email('info@spatie.be')
    ->contactPoint(Schema::contactPoint()->areaServed('Worldwide'));

$localBusiness->toScript();
```

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "http:\/\/schema.org",
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "name": "Spatie",
    "email": "info@spatie.be",
    "contactPoint": {
        "@type": "ContactPoint",
        "areaServed": "Worldwide"
    }
}
</script>
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/schema-org
```

## Usage

All types can be instantiated though the `Spatie\SchemaOrg\Schema` factory class, or with the `new` keyword.

``` php
$localBusiness = Schema::localBusiness()->name('Spatie');

// Is equivalent to:

$localBusiness = new LocalBusiness();
$localBusiness->name('Spatie');
```

> *All types also accept arrays of the expected data type, for example `sameAs` accepts a string or an array of strings.*

All types also implement the SPL's `ArrayAccess` for accessing the properties via array notation:

```php
$anotherLocalBusiness = new LocalBusiness();
var_dump(isset($anotherLocalBusiness['name'])); // => false
$anotherLocalBusiness['name'] = 'Spatie';
var_dump(isset($anotherLocalBusiness['name'])); // => true
var_dump($anotherLocalBusiness['name']); // => 'Spatie'
unset($anotherLocalBusiness['name']);
var_dump(isset($anotherLocalBusiness['name'])); // => false
```

Types can be converted to an array or rendered to a script.

```php
$localBusiness->toArray();

$localBusiness->toScript();

echo $localBusiness; // Same output as `toScript()`
```

Additionally, all types can be converted to a plain JSON string by just calling `json_encode()` with your object:

```php
echo json_encode($localBusiness);
```

### Enumerations

As of v1.6.0, all [Enumeration](http://schema.org/Enumeration) child types are available as classes with constants.

```php
Schema::book()->bookFormat(Spatie\Schema\BookFormatType::Hardcover);
```

There's no full API documentation for types and properties. You can refer to [the source](https://github.com/spatie/schema-org/tree/master/src) or to [the schema.org website](http://schema.org).

If you don't want to break the chain of a large schema object, you can use the `if` method to conditionally modify the schema.

```php
use Spatie\SchemaOrg\LocalBusiness;
use Spatie\SchemaOrg\Schema;

$business = ['name' => 'Spatie'];

$localBusiness = Schema::localBusiness()
    ->name($business['name'])
    ->if(isset($business['email']), function (LocalBusiness $schema) {
        $schema->email($business['email']);
    });
```

I recommended double checking your structured data with [Google's structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)

### Advanced Usage

If you'd need to set a custom property, you can use the `setProperty` method.

```php
$localBusiness->setProperty('foo', 'bar');
```

If you'd need to retrieve a property, you can use the `getProperty` method. You can optionally pass in a second parameter to provide a default value.

```php
$localBusiness->getProperty('name'); // 'Spatie'
$localBusiness->getProperty('bar'); // null
$localBusiness->getProperty('bar', 'baz'); // 'baz'
```

All properties can be retrieved as an array with the `getProperties` method.

```php
$localBusiness->getProperties(); // ['name' => 'Spatie', ...]
```

Multiple properties can be set at once using the `addProperties` method.

```php
$localBusiness->addProperties(['name' => 'value', 'foo' => 'bar']);
```

Context and type can be retrieved with the `getContext` and `getType` methods.

```php
$localBusiness->getContext(); // 'http://schema.org'
$localBusiness->getType(); // 'LocalBusiness'
```

### Graph - multiple items

The Graph has a lot of methods and utilities - the type-safe and simplest way is to use the overloaded methods of the `Spatie\SchemaOrg\Schema` class itself. These methods will get an already created or new instance of the requested schema.

```php
$graph = new Graph();

// Create a product and prelink organization
$graph
    ->product()
    ->name('My cool Product')
    ->brand($graph->organization());

// Hide the organization from the created script tag
$graph->hide(\Spatie\SchemaOrg\Organization::class);

// Somewhere else fill out the organization
$graph
    ->organization()
    ->name('My awesome Company');

// Render graph to script tag
echo $graph;
```

With these tools the graph is a collection of all available schemas, can link these schemas with each other and prevent helper schemas from being rendered in the script-tag.

## Known Issues

### Type Inheritance

The spec rdfa document that's used to generate this code uses single inheritance for the types. However, the spec on http://schema.org uses multiple inheritance in some cases. Read the docs and use [Google's structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool) to ensure you're on the right track!

For example, according to the rdfa, a `LocalBusiness` inherits properties from `Organization`. However, if you visit the spec page on [Schema.org](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness), it inherits properties from `Organization` and `Place`. The current solution is by manually specifying properties on the item, as described above in [advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

```php
Schema::localBusiness()

    // `address` is part of `Organization`, so the method exists
    ->address(/* ... */)

    // `openingHoursSpecification` is part of `Place`, so we need to manually add it
    ->setProperty('openingHoursSpecification', /* ... */);
```

### Other Minor Issues

- The `Float` type isn't available since it's a reserved keyword in PHP
- The `Physician` type isn't available since it extends a type from the `health` extension spec
